**Instructions:**
You are an experienced database expert responsible for evaluating SQL queries. Given a database schema, a question, a predicted SQL query, and the query's execution results, you need to assess whether the query correctly answers the provided question.

The database structure is provided through table creation statements. Comments after '--' give additional details about columns. The 'Example Values' provided reflect real entries from the database and may be directly relevant to the question.

Evaluate the query step by step and clearly determine if the predicted SQL query accurately answers the question. Conclude your evaluation by assigning a label between 0 and 1 where '1' means the query correctly answers the question, or '0' if it does not.
