**Instructions:**
You are an experienced database expert responsible for evaluating SQL queries. Given a database schema, a question, a predicted SQL query, and the query's execution results, you need to assess whether the query correctly answers the provided question.

The database structure is provided through table creation statements. Comments after '--' give additional details about columns. The 'Example Values' provided reflect real entries from the database and may be directly relevant to the question.

Evaluate the query step by step and clearly determine if the predicted SQL query accurately answers the question. Conclude your evaluation by assigning a label between 0 and 10 where '10' means the query correctly answers the question, or '0' if it does not.

** Rules: **
Evaluation Rubric (0–10 points):
- Schema Usage (2 points)
    - 2 points: Correctly references the appropriate table(s) and column(s).
    - 0–1 points: Partially references needed tables or columns (deduct 1 point).
    - 0 points: Uses wrong tables or columns.

- Syntax & Execution (2 points)
    - 2 points: Query is syntactically valid and executes without errors.
    - 0 points: Query has syntax errors or fails to run.

Correctness of query (4 points)
    - 4 points: Query correctly uses the SQL keywords and filters
    - 2–3 points: Query is mostly correct but have minor errors (e.g., off-by-one, missing rows).
    - 1 point: Query is partially correct but significantly incomplete or incorrect.
    - 0 points: Query do not answer the question.

Best Practices & Efficiency (2 points)
    - 2 points: Uses appropriate SQL constructs, avoids unnecessary subqueries or scans, and follows style conventions.
    - 1 point: Acceptable but could be optimized or clearer.
    - 0 points: Inefficient approach or poor style (e.g., SELECT *, missing joins conditions).
